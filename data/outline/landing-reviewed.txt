So after you submitted your bug to get a review, you'll get an email that looks either like this:
Show an r- email

Or like this:
Show an r+ email

---

If you get an r- you need to make changes to your patch, do an hg qrefresh to put the changes back in.
Re-attach the patch to the bug, and re-request a review from the same reviewer.


If you get an r+, congratulations your patch is ready to land.

----

If you haven't run the patch through tests yet, and if you don't have commit access level 1 yet, you should ask the reviewer if they
can run it through try for you.  

They may respond that they don't think it's needed, or they may run it try tests for you.

Ask them after a day if everything is good with the try push if they haven't responded back.

If you don't have commit access yet, what you should do at this point is add the keyword:
checkin-needed

At that point someone will come along and land the patch on an what's called an integration branch.
If you're doing platform related code, then your patch would land your patch on the mozilla-inbound integration branch.
If you're doing front end related code, then your patch would land your patch on the fx-team integration branch.

---

If you do happen to have commit access level 1, what you'd do is land the patch yourself on an integration branch.  And then paste the link 
to the changeset in the bug.
