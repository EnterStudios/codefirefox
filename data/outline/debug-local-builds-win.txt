In this video I'm going to show you how to debug your local build.

---

So it's best to use debug builds, because more debugging information is avaialble to you.
You can enable that in the .mozconfig file, please see the mozconfig video for more information there.

---

So the first thing I'll do is open up visual studio.
It shoudl be under the name vs express for desktop if you're using vs 2012

---

So to debug your local build, you need to first start the browser.
> mach run

---

So let's say we're debugging a problem with the color picker.
> Show code for color picker

---

So I happen to know that the code for this color picker is in widget/windows/nsColorPicker.cpp

---


So my first step is to go to that code, and set a breakpoint.
You can set a breakpoint just by clicking to the left of the line of code.

---


Next you want to attach to the running process.
To do this go to Tools -> Attach to process
