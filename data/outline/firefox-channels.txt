Firefox Desktop comes in 4 different flavours, also called channels.
You can install a build from any of these 4 different channels, and then get updates to remain on that channel over time.

These channels are:
Nightly builds (you can find it at this URL: http://nightly.mozilla.org/ )
Pre-release build called Aurora channel (You can find the rest at this URL: http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/#aurora)
A pre-release build called Beta channel
A released build called Release channel

Code always lands on the Nightly channel fist. 

On every 6 week interval, the code on Nightly gets promoted to Aurora.
6 weeks after that, the same code gets landed onto Beta.
6 weeks after that, the same code goes to Release.

Why?
So why not just do development in one big repository?
If everything laned directly on Release then we'd have an unstable product.

So instead it goes into a repository where Nightly builds are managed.
But some people want early accesss to features but a bit more stability, so that's what Aurora is for.

And Beta is basically a release candidate. We do final testing there and try to make it as close to the actual release as possible.
That's why you see it using the same logo.

The Firefox source code is primarily managed with Mercurial.
Some people are starting to use Git as well, but I'll show you mercurial because that's what most people are using.

So Mozilla manages a lot of source code, some side projects are on github, but most of the main source code is available
at:

hg.mozilla.org

The nightly channel is called mozilla-central and you can get it here.
The other channels: Auora, Beta, and Release are under the subfolder called releases

So what we're going to want on our machine is mozilla-central, since that's where changes go to first.
