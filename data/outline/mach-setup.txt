We want to eventually build the Firefox source code, and to do that, the best way is to use a tool called mach.

Open up mozilla-build folder
Open up msvc-11 file for vs2012
Mach is a python script.

ls -la mach
Open the mach file

Mach is not only used for building the sourcce code, but it is also used to accomplish a bunch of different
tasks that we'll see over time like running tests, searching code, and in general just making your life easier.

The first time you run mach on your computer, it's going to do some configuration.
So let's get that over with, and please note that you never need to do this more than once.


You can type mach help for a full list of mach commands

> mach help

You can also type mach help <command> for help on that specific command.

> mach help build
