In this video I'm going to go over the internals of your patch queue.

Your patch queue is stored in .hg/patches/

> ls .hg/patches

It consists of all of the patches you've created, as well as 2 special files.

series: Which stores all the patches and the order they will be applied
status: Which stores the patches that are applied


As a general rule, never modify the status file.
You can modify the series file, though.

---

The general rule for the series file is to only modify the order of the files which are not yet
applied.

And in general it's usually better to use hg qpush --move and hg qremove for removal and moving.
