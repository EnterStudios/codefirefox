We seen in the last video that patch queues allow you to apply and unapply patches.

What we didn't see was how to work with multiple different patches.
This video will cover working with multiple patches.

So let's say we have one patch applied:
hg qapplied

And we want to create a second patch which is independent of the first, for some new bug.

Let's say this new bug has a bugzilla ID 777777.

The first thing we're going to do is make a change, just as if we wanted it included in the last patch
But instead of using hg qref, we'll use hg qnew.

hg qnew bug7777777_comment.diff -m "Added a comment"


Now if we look at our patch queue we'll see 2 patches applied:

hg qseries

Just as before we can unapply these patches one at a time by using:

hg qpop

See now we're back at the first patch only:

hg qseries

hg qpush
Now the last comment I wanted to talk about is to explain how to get changes into a particular patch in your queue.

To do this, just think of your patch queue like a stack of plates. As you "apply" another patch, you add a plate to the top of the stack.  And if you put food on those plates, then the food would go on the top plate.
