So once you create a patch, you're probably anxious to see this patch landed into the mozilla-central.

Before you can do this you first need to get a review.
And before you get a review you need to attach the patch to a bug in bugzilla and ask for a review.

If there isn't already a bug posted, you'll want to create a new one first.

So I loaded up an example bugzilla bug and I'm going to attach a patch to it.

I'm going to scroll down and attach a file.

Select the file.

Flag for review, suggested reviewers.

Now you shouldn't wait more than a couple days ot hear something back.
You aren't guaranteed to get a review within that time, but you should at least hear back from the
reivewer.

If you don't, find them on IRC, or find someone on IRC that can help you with it.
Or you can try to just flag someone else for a review.

--

What you'll end up getting eventually is some feedback from a reviewer.
They'll either r+ the patch which means it is good to land, or they'll cancel the request with some information, or they mark it with r- which means it is not ok to land.

Don't get discouraged with an r-. It is not a rejection of the work you've done, it's just that some things need to be changed.  I've done several hundred patches and still often get r-, it is just part of the process.
