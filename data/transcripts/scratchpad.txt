In this video I'm going to introduce you to the scratchpad developer tool.
This is an awesome tool that allows you to run code on the fly without having to write it to a file,
build, and run.

So you'd use the scratchpad mainly for prototyping code, or trying things out quickly.

You may already know about the scratchpad for modifying different web pages.
I'll go over it for web pages first, then I'll show you how to use it for Firefox development.

Code entered into the scratchpad applies to the currently selected tab.
So when we do something like:

> document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].style.backgroundColor = 'red';

And run it.

It will apply only to the selected tab.

You can also use selection to only execute what is selected.
So if I change to 'blue' and add an alert('hi');
And only select alert, run, it won't change the background to blue.


devtools.chrome.enabled



document.getElementById('urlbar').style.backgroundColor='red';
