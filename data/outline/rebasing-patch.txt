In this video I'm going to show you what it looks like to try and apply a patch that has a conflict.

This may happen to you for example if you're working on a patch for a while, then you pop off your patch,
pull down remote patches, and then try to re-push your patch.  If someone made a change in a similar file,
then you'll get a conflict.

The patch I'm going to use is from bug 924900.

---

So I have the patch already in my queue ready to be pushed.
The next thing I need to do is simply type hg qpush


Normally this would finish with no output.

But this time it spits out a lot of things.

You can see here that it says HUNK X failed, well most of the patch actually succeeded to apply
but you have one file here, Y, which failed.  Each file actually has different hunks, or parts,
and only one of the 3 parts failed.

Open up the rej file.

Rej file shows you what needs to be applied, but couldn't be applied.

What you need to do is manually apply these changes.

So now I'm going to open the other file without .rej extension.

Apply fix.
