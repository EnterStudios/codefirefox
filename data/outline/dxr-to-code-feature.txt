In this video we're going to code a feature from scratch, with the help of dxr to do it.
---

Let's say you're working on a bug and that bug asks you to add a new checkbox to Firefox
options, and that checkbox would control whether or not Jump lists are enabled.

----


So if you don't know what jump lists are, they are a feature of Windows where on your
taskbar icons, you have a bunch of shortcuts.

---


So we want a feature that will enable and disable this feature,
and let's say the task is to add it to the options.

> Open firefox options.

> Show the similar checkbox in the Tabs tab for Show tab previews

We'd want to add another checkbox here.


---

What I'll do next is now that I've found a similar option, I'll search the code for its
text to see what that brings up.

---

So I'm going to open up dxr.mozilla.org and I'm going to type:
> Show tab preview

But that brings up a lot of unrelated results for each found word.
I actually want an exact match, so I'll type it in quotes.


> Add quotes

---

It comes up with only 1 match, so I'm going to click that dtd file.
It looks like this is where strings are listed.

---

Go open that file and make a copy and add the next text.

---
....
Continue to do task until done.

> mach build browser 
> mach run
> And show the feature.
