In this video we're going to learn how to make a patch file.

A patch file is a collection of changes to the source code.
These patch files are typically uploaded to bugs.

First we're going to make a change to the source code.
Don't focus too much on what we're changing, it isn't important for this video.

<make some edits>

To create a patch file for those changes:
hg qnew bug123456_whitespacefixes.diff

This opens up your default editor with a blank window.
You need to put a message here to describe what you're fixing.

The format of that message should look like:
Bug 123456 - Fixed some whitespace problems

Next we're going to look at that patch file.
You can find it in the .hg/patches/bug123456_whitespacefixes.diff file.
