In this video we'll learn about the DOM Inspector, and how to use it to help you with Firefox development.

DOM stands for Document Object Model, and it's basically just an in memory representation of a web page
and / or XML document.  It also provides an API to work with that in memory representation.

The DOM Inspector allows you to "inspect" the DOM, but also edit it and manipulate it.

At the time of this video, there's actually a built in Firefox tool called the Inspector, you can
for example right click on a document and select inspect, and that'll show you that element and allow
you to modify it.

This video isn't going to cover that though, this video is going to introduce you to an add-on called
the DOM Inspector.
