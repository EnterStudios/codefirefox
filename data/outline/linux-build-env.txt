In this video we're going to setup a fresh install of Ubuntoo (oo-boon-too)


The good news is that this is actualy the easiest environment to setup for Firefox development.

So I'm going to go up to the search box and type:
Firefox linux build mdn

MDN stands for mozilla developer network.

Next I'm going to copy this wget command

<paste in terminal>

<walk through process>

<done>
