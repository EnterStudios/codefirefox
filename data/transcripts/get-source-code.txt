This video assumes you already have your development environment setup.

The first thing we're going to do is go to mozilla-build, and open up msvc-11.bat which
corresponds to the installed VS2012.

There's 2 ways to get the source code:
1) Using hg (if you have a good internet connection)
2) Using a pre-packaged bundle downloaded from the website (if you have a bad internet connection)

We're going ot do both in this video. 

If you have a good internet connection, the easiest thing to do is just to use hg clone

> mkdir projects/mozilla
> cd projects/mozilla
> hg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central

Pause video, tell them it'll take a while... 
OK we're resume now.

Now if things succeeded for you, like they did on my end. You'll have a new subfolder called mozilla-central
You can also probably drop off the video at this point too.

If things didn't work for you, then let's go ahead and grab a bundle.

First we're going to move the old directory out of the way
mv mozilla-central _old

Next we want to do is create a new hg repo and use hg unbundle

> hg init
> hg unbundle ~/downloads/

Pause, Resume.

The bundle may be a bit outdated, use hg pull and hg update to get the latest changes
