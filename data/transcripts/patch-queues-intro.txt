Mercurial patch queues allow you to work on multiple different patches at the same time.
But to be honest it should have been called a patch stack.

You only need few hg commands to fully understand patch qeueues,
those are: hg qpop, hg qpush, hg qapplied, and hg qseries

So let's say you have a single patch already created.
You can use qseries to see that the patch is in your path queue:
hg qseries

You can use qapplied to see that the patch is applied:
hg qapplied


So qseries and qapplied looks the same.
The difference comes in when you unapply a patch.

hg qpop

Now i I use hg qseries it still shows me what's in my queue:
hg qseries

Same as before.

But the difference is with qapplied.
Since we popped off the patch it is no longer applied.


hg qapplied


See nothing is applied.










Assume we have this patch file, which fixes some whitespace:

Show diff of patch.

And suddenly we realize that we should have also fixed some more whitespace just below.

We could create a second patch file using qnew for the new change, but ideally we want the change in the same file.

To do this we simply modify the file as usual, with the new change.

Make a change to browser/base/content/browser.js

And then we type hg qref

And that's it! 

If you go look at the new patch file, you'll see that it now has that additional change in it.
