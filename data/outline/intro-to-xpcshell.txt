The xpcshell is a JavaScript shell that has access to XPCOM.
It also has access to things like JavaScript modules.

An xpcshell test is a test that's written using the xpcshell.


To begin this video I'll just show you an example of using the xpcshell.
This is usually located in your objdir's dist/bin and then you'll find a xpcshell binary.


So I'm not going to do much here but I'll just show you that it's a normal JavaScript shell.
And I'll show you that you can access Compoennts.classes
for (c in Components.classes) { dump(c + '\n'); }

Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/osfile.jsm");
OS.File.read

Shows you that there's a function there.

----

To run all xpchsell tests you'd just run:
mach xpcshell-test
But this would take a long time.

----

To run a directory of xpcshell tests, you run:
mach xpcshell-test 

So I'm going to show you how to run those tests here.
mach xpcshell-test toolkit/components/osfile

You can also specify a single file simply by specifying the path to that file
mach xpcshell-test toolkit/compoents/osfile/..../....jsm

In subsequent videos I'll show you how to create an xpcshell test,
and also show you running and creating other automated test types.
