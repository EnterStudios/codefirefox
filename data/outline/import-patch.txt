In this video we're going to learn how to import a patch that someone else created.
I'll show you 2 different ways to do this, one from the local filesystem, and another directly from the web.

---

So let's say I'm doing a review, and I want to test out someone else's funcitonality before I review it.
Or perhaps I Just want to import someone else's patch so I have it locally.

--

What I can do is load up the page and download the patch file.
Done.

--

Now the next thing I'm going to do is open up my terminal and hg qimport the patch

hg qimport ~/Downloads/bug9249...

...

Do the same with the remote patch.
