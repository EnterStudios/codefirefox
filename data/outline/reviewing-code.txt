The first thing you want to do when reviewing is ask:

Is this something we want to do?
There are a lot of people posting bugs, and it's not always true that we need everything that gets posted.

You usually want to try out the patch, to do this you can hg qimport directly into your patch queue.
There's a video on that.

You'll also want to future proof your code by creating unit tests.
For a lot of bugs it's ok to ask for a test.
Sometimes it may be possible to file a follow up bug for a unit test to be added.

Make sure the file matches the style of the code it's landing with.
Check for things like trailing whitespace on lines, or making sure unix newlines are used.
Check for things like alignment and placing of whitespace operators and function braces in code.


What you don't want to do is review bassed on exactly what you would do.


Check for security, privacy, resource leaks, performance,
