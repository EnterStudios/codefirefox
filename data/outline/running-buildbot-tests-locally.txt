In a previous video I went over how buildbot is used to run tests,
and the tests appear on tbpl, which is right in front of me.

I also went over a high level overview of what each test type does.

In this video I want to show you how to run theses tests locally,
in the same way that buildbot does.

Now you can always just click the + button to run again, but
sometimes you'll want to run them locally.

We're going to use the mach test command.
And to see the parameters we can pass, we can type ./mach help test

./mach help test


So for example if I wanted to run all of the crash tests

./mach test crashtest
./mach test xpcshell
./mach test mochitest-1
./mach test jetpack


./mach help test



In subsequent videos I'll go over running and creating each test type.
