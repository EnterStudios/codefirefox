In this video I'm going to show you how to post a bug in Bugzilla.

Every code change that happens in Firefox is tracked by a bug in Bugzilla.

And whether you want to help with testing, or help with development, knowing how to post a
good bug is absolutely needed.

---

So the first step before posting a bug is to perform a search to see if the bug already exists.

There's a couple of ways to do that, you can either use bugzilla, or you can just use
google.

----

site:bugzilla.mozilla.org Ability to duplicate tabs

----

So let's say there was a bug you wanted to post about tabs.
And let's pretend there was a crash if you try to close the last tab.

Short summary of the bug:
Firefox crashes when dragging a single tab across different Firefox windows.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Click 3 times in the content area of a web page
3. Open a second Firefox window
4. Drag a tab from one window to another
5. Drop the tab on the second window

Actual results:
Firefox crashes!

Expected results:
Firefox shouldn't crash, it should add that tab to the second window.

Is this bug always reproducible?
Is there any other information that you can post to help a developer reproduce?
Can you take a screenshot or post a video of the problem?

Ask yourself, if oyu are able to simplify the steps or remove an uneeded step that has information that is not relavent to the bug.
