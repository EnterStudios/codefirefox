In this video we're going to talk about reftests
reftests will render 1 web page, then it'll render another web page,
and then compare them visually, pixel by pixel.

If either rendered page differ by even a single pixel,
the test fails.  If all pixels match, it'll pass.

----

To run all the reftests you would type:

./mach reftest

---

To run a particular set of reftest you specify its .list file:

This is similar to the xpcshell.ini files we talked about in the xpcshell test video.
But the .list file specifies the path of 2 reference pages to compare.

./mach reftest content/html/content/reftests/reftest.list > out.txt 2>&1

There's a lot of output so I'm going to redirect everything to a file.

---

So now I'm going to open up that log file, and if you scroll to the bottom you can see that it passed.
But if you want to see exactly what passed, just search in the file for:
/successful:

You can see that it says all 54 passed.


---

You can also run a single reftest, but not as easily as you may think.
To do it you need to specify the .list file but also specify a regular expression.
If the items in the .list file matches the regular expression, then the test is run.
Otherwise it is not run.

For example: 
mach reftest content/html/content/reftests/reftest.list --filter .*52019.*


---

But be careful when you run these tests. If you interact with the window while the tests are running, you have a chance of affecting the results.
You'll start to see failures. For example you may change the selection or add a focus ring.
So if I run again, and this time interact with the window while it's running.

./mach reftest ...

You'll see that it says it failed for some subset of the tests.
Looking at the log again, it shows X failures.

----

These tests are not for things that require elevated privleges
