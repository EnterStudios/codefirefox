In the last video I gave an introduction to reftests.
Which is basically just rendering 2 pages and then seeing if they
visually match.

In this video I'll go over how to create your own.

---

First I just wanted tos how you the python script that gets run from
mach to run reftests.
layout/tools/reftest/runreftest.py


If you want to use it directly, you can, and you will have more control.

----

The next thing I want to do is add my new test to a reftest.list file
content/html/content/reftests/reftest.list

test1.html and test2.html


./mach reftest content/html/content/reftests/reftest.list 
--filter .*test[12].html.*




-----



The base reftest.list file that is processed is located at:
layout/reftests/reftest.list 

So if you create a new reftest.list file you'll want to mention its path there.
