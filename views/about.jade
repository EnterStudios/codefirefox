    h1 Becoming a Mozillian
    p Becoming a Mozilla contributor can be intimidating.  There's a lot of information to consume, and that information can be dispersed in a variety of different places.  This site aim to outline the process of becoming a Mozilla contributor, from start to finish, with gentle, short, consumable 2-10 minute videos.  Exercises are also used to solidify learnt concepts.

    h1 Site Direction
    p This site first aims to focus on Desktop Firefox videos from the ground up.  I'd love to also do videos on Firefox for Android, Firefox for Windows 8 style UI, and for Firefox OS.

    h1 Video Creation
    p The content on this site is produced on OS X with ScreenFlow. The videos are recorded in a local VMWare Windows 8 guest OS.  The audio is recorded with a Blue Yeti microphone.

    h1 Exercise Framework
    :markdown
      The exercise framework is created by parsing the JavaScript source using acorn.js.  This parses the code into an abstract parse tree which is then analyzed against a whitelist and blacklist of goals powered by [codecheck.js](http://github.com/bbondy/codecheckjs). codecheck.js allows for advanced feedback based on the program structure.
      
      Other exercise types other than JavaScript are still in progress.
      
      The Ace editor is used for syntax highlighting and basic error detection.
