People who are part of the Mozilla community, and believe in Mozilla's mission
call themselves Mozillians.


Often these people also take action to promote and help Mozilla's mission of keeping the web
open.  Often these people also interact and collaborate with other community members.

In this video I'll show you how to register yourself as a Mozillian, and how to get vouched.

Being registered as a Mozillian means that you can have a public, or private, and only
accessible to other Mozillian's profile.


Having a Mozillians profile allows you to promote your skills, but also may lead to,
for example, an invitation to a Mozilla event or other free stuff.
