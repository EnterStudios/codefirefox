I'm not going to go over everything, because some things you'll probably never touch, and
because I don't know everything, but I'll introduce you to a few different top level directories.


b2g - Code for Firefox OS

browser - Firefox front end, this code is in Javascript, CSS, and XUL. If you're a web developer
          you already have a lot of the needed tools to get started here.

browser/metro - The Firefox for Windows 8 front end code. Again this uses JS, CSS, and JavaScript

build - code for the build process

dom - contains a definition of the DOM specificaiton, implementation of some of the DOM
content - This is probably what most people think of when they think of browser source code: HTML, SVG, XML, implementaiton fo DOM interfaces, link handling, form behavior, etc.
docshell - object for managing document windows, methods for loading URIs 
db - sqlite
editor
extensions - prepackaged extensions that can be included at build time.
gfx - graphics library, directx, opengl code
image - image encoders and decoders
ipc - inter process communicaiton library, most of this code started as a fork of chromium's ipc
js - the javascript engine
layout - code that manages the rendering tree
mobile - this is the android front end code.
netwerk - networking library, called necko, http client implementation, cache, etc.
nsprpub - Netscape Portable Runtime, a bunch of everything, not very pretty
parser - different parsers like for example an html parser
profile - Code for the profile manager front and back end
security - NSS and security sandboxing
startupcache - Pretty self explanatory, manages things liek 

toolkit - Has a ton of shared common code, things like downloads, preferences, updates, installer, maintenance service, filepicker, ...
