In a previous video I talked about .mozconfig files.

.mozconfig files are useful because they allow you to enable and disable different options, build different products, or change environment settings like your build directory.

In this video I'm going to walk you through a use case of using 2 mozconfig files.
1 for release, and 1 for debug. 

First we'll create 2 mozconfig files.

Name the first .mozconfig-release
> mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/obj-release

Name the second .mozconfig-debug
> mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/obj-debug
> ac_add_options --enable-debug 


To select the mozconfig we'll use:
> export MOZCONFIG=/c/projects/mozilla/mozilla-central/.mozconfig-release
> export MOZCONFIG=/c/projects/mozilla/mozilla-central/.mozconfig-debug

Now having multiple mozconfig files is not for everyone.
Some people may prefer to simply have 2 checked out source code directories, and that's perfectly fine.
But the advantage of having 2 mozconfig files is that you will:
i) Use less disk space
and ii) Can work wiht 1 patch queue with 2 different build enviornments.
