So at this point we have a full build of Firefox done, and we ran the Firefox built from source code.
This build took a long time, perhaps 1-3h depending on your computer.

The good news is that future builds will be a lot faster.


Now after you make some change, you can always run:
mach build

But running mach build again can still take a while, for example it may take 10 minutes or 15 minutes.

So what you can do instead is run mach build
subdirectory-path-that-you-changed

So if you make a change inside the browser folder, you only need to run mach build browser.

If you're going to be changing front end code like XUL, Javascript and CSS,
then your builds will be blazing fast.

If you're going to be changing C++ code, then your builds will be a bit slower
as expected, but still workable.  Like a minute.

So what we're going to do is make a change, and show how fast it is to build it.
Don't pay too much attention to what we're changing, it's just to demonstrate
how to build incrementally.

> Modify browser/base/content/browser.css
Add a rule:
#urlbar {
  background-color: red;
}

Run:

> mach build browser/base/content > out.txt 2>&1

And the change is built, if you don't see any errors that's a good thing.

Now let's go run the browser to see the change live!

> mach run

And as you can see we have a red URL bar!
