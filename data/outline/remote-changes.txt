So as you work on a bug, there are also hundreds of other people doing the same thing.
During the time that you spend on your bug, a lot of these people will be landing their bugs on mozilla-central.

So what you want to do about once a week or so, or if you need some change that you don't already have
is pull down the remote changes.

--

So let's say I have 2 patches applied
> hg qapplied


Now the first thing I want to do is pop off all of my work:

> hg qpop -a


Then pull in the remote work:

> hg pull


And finally do an hg update.

> hg update

As long as there are no conflicts at this point you can re-push all of your patches

hg qpush -a
