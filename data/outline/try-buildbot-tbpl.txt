So let's say you have a patch ready, and I want to see if it passes all of the tests on each operating system.

You could try to run the tests locally, but you are probably only running one or two operating system locally.

Mozilla provides something called the try server, that will run your patch through whichever operating systems, and running whichever tests you want, possibly all.

So before you land any patch on mozilla-central, the first step is to run it through the try server. 

To do this you need to create a special patch message that indicates which operating systems and tests to run, then push both your patch, and an empty patch with that message to try.
http://hg.mozilla.org/try/

The results wil display on TBPL here:
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try

----

So I'm going to go through the whole process, and explain along the way

From your checked out m-c directory
(show it)
->
Create a patch file
(show it applied)
-> 
Create a second patch file with a special message that tells buildbot what to do.
hg qnew try_all_options -m "try: -b do -p all -u all -t all"

->
land these patches on hg.mozilla.org/try (show in Firefox)
hg push -f try

->

Since we're pushign from mozilla-central directly, 
this will create a remote head because you didn't merge your change into hg.mozilla.org/try

->

buildbot, comes along, and looks at the tip of each push.

->
processes each tip and creates a build on each major operating system
->
tests are run for those builds on more operating systems than the builds were made
->
results are reported back to tbpl.

---

so when I push to http://hg.mozilla.org/try/, it creates a remote head right.  
A changeset that goes in just after one of your pushes, won't necessarily have your change in it, since it's a different head (unless the next changeset happened to pull in your change before they pushed).

---

so buildbot (which is probably some python glue) goes through each of the tips of the pushes to try, and creates a build from them on each supported operating system and archcitecture. Then each of these builds get run on different physical computers for each category of tests, on a bigger variety of operating sytems than the builds were performed on.

---

To push to try you need Mozilla Level 1 push access, there's a video on the outline about that if you don't have it yet.

---

Once something is pushed to the try repository, buildbot comes along and kicks off builds on various machines.
Typically this is one build per operating system per architecture.

Once those builds are done, a series of tests are run on other machines for each opearting system.

All of the results then go back to to tinderboxpuhlog (tbpl).
