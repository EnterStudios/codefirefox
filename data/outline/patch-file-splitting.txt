I've shown you in past videos how to create patch files, and qrefresh your changes into those patch files. I've also shown you how to work with multiple patch files.

But sometimes when you're working on a larger bug, you'll find that you need to split a
single patch file in 2.  

Sometimes splitting a patch file in 2 is necessary for getting reviews, if 2 different people need to review 2 different parts of the code.   

Sometimes you may decide that you want to post a separate bug about part of the changes you made because they don't fit completely in the current bug.

To do this you still use the qrefresh (qref command)

> Create 3 files: file1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt
> hg add them

Show the patch file


<show an example of hg qref -X and hg qref>
