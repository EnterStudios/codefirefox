This video is about Debugging!

I'm going to do 2 things in this video
1) Introduce you to the debugger built into Firefox to debug a web page.
2) Transfer that knowledge, and show you how to use it to debug the browser itself

I won't show you all of the features that you can use yet, but just a few basics.


So first I'm going to show you the most simple example I could think up.
This is the page source, all it does is pick 2 numbers, and then adds them.

But there's a bug.
And that bug is that the result of x + y is just x + y, not x + y + 1



Show:
- Setting a breakpoint
- Call stack
- Stepping through code
- Watch window
- Locals, globals

Fix bug, run it
