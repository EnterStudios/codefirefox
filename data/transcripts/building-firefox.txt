To buid Firefox, we're goin to use our checked out source code from mozilla-central.
Open up mozilla-build folder
Open up msvc-11 file for vs2012

To build the source code we're goin to use a tool called mach.
Mach is not only used for building the sourcec code, but it is also used to accomplish a bunch of different
tasks that we'll see over time.
Mach is a python script.

The first time you run mach on your computer, it's going to do some configuration.
So let's get that over with, and please note that you never need to do this more than once.

After that's done we're ready to build:
Type mach build > out.txt 2>&1

- Behind the scenes this is creating a configure file, which amongst other things sets up your environment and detects where you're building.
- Processes build config files, those are the moz.build files, and you can think of them as makefiles
- Building, linking, and packaging.

This process can take a long time, maybe even a couple hours to run.
Once you're done building, you'll find a file that looks like this: out.txt

And now we're ready to run firefox. You can do this in a couple ways:
1) Type mach run
or 
2) Open up objdir_debug/dist/bin/firefox.exe
