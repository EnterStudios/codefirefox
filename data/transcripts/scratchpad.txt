Code entered into the scratchpad applies to the currently selected tab.
So when we do something like:

> document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].style.backgroundColor = 'red';

And run it.

It will apply only to the selected tab.

You can also use selection to only execute what is selected.
So if I change to 'blue' and add an alert('hi');
And only select alert, run, it won't change the background to blue.
