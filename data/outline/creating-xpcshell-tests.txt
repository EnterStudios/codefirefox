Now to create a test you usually find a similar test, and put it alongside of it.

Let's say we want to create a test for the OSFile JavaScript module.

toolkit/components/osfile/tests/xpcshell/

[test_1.js]
function run_test() {
  do_check_true(true);
}

The test system needs to know where your file is.
To do that you need to add it into an xpcshell.ini file.

In the subsequent videos I'll show you how to create a video from scratch
and also more advanced, non trivial things you can do inside xpcshell tests.

You're creating a brand new xpcom component, then you'd create your own 
xpcshell.ini and you need to reference it from the parent moz.build file.
XPCSHELL_TESTS_MANIFESTS += ['path/to/xpcshell.ini']
So I won't do that but I'll just show you what that looks like.
