So let's say you're looking into fixing a bug with how files launch.

--

So let's pretend we already have a good idea of which file the problem is in.

> gvim xpcom/io/nsLocalFileWin.cpp

Don't worry too much about if you have no idea what the code is doing, or even if you don't know
C++.  That isn't the important part of this video.

----

Now we also happen to know that there is this function called "Launch" that gets run that opens a file.

----

Now as you read the code, you may think to yourself, who wrote this code? or why is this being done? You may want a bit more background information on why the code is like it is.


----


For that purpose you can use something called hg annotate, often refered to as hg blame.

----


So we're going to first type:

> hg annotate -lc xpcom/io/nsLocalFileWin.cpp

The l is for line number
The c is for changeset

----

Now so can bring up information of that changeset with hg log

> hg log -r 51863ce4e87d

You can get the revision just before that changset by using ^ (caret)
> hg log -r 51863ce4e87d^


Well it's often useful to see what the code looked like and what hte changesets were just before a revision.  So we can use 


Some of the file IO in C++ is done with this class nsLocalFileWin.
