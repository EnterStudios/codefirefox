In a previous video I went over how buildbot is used to run tests,
and the tests appear on tbpl, which is right in front of me.

I also went over a high level overview of what each test type does.

In this video I want to show you how to run theses tests locally,
in the same way that buildbot does.

Now you can always just click the + button to run again, but
sometimes you'll want to run them locally.


./mach help test

./mach test crashtest
./mach test xpcshell
./mach test mochitest-1
./mach test jetpack


./mach help test



In subsequent videos I'll go over running and creating each test type.
