Mozilla has a lot of code, and this code is split up into modules.
Each module has an owner and peers who help the owner.

Module owners and peers will be listed here:
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/All


----

For each module there's a name, a description of what it is.
Usually one, but sometimes multiple owners
A list of peers
Source directories (if applicable, not all modules are about code)
Discussion groups for that module, and URLs that are helping for that module.

-----

So what are the responsibilities of these owners and peers?
Overall, an owner, and peers of a module are people who make decisions about a module.
A decision often boils down to a code review, approving code to go in that section fo code.
... but it's actually a lot more than just that....

-----

Reponsibilities include: maintaining the code, making sure the code has tests,
improving it, triaging it, documenting it, reviewing it, having a vision for it, comunity involvement, etc..

A module owner doesn't take on all of these tasks on by themselves, they enlist module peers to help them. 
A module peer does basically the same thing as a module owner.
