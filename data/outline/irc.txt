Mozilla is VERY distributed.
To work closely together, and get a sense of unity, we use IRC (Internet Relay Chat) to communicate.

IRC has been around forever, and there are a ton of different clients that all use the same protocol.
So you have a vast number of choices for what to choose.


The chat server is: irc.mozilla.org
And it uses the default port of 6697

So first you'll want to use an IRC client.

On Windows I like to use adiIRC, some people like mIRC, but it's not free after some trial period.
On OS X I prefer to use LimeChat.

There are a ton of different IRC clients, and it doesn't really matter which one you choose.
Try out a couple and take oyur pick.

So I'm going to download adiIRC, install it, and connect to some channels that you should start with.
