So let's say you found a good bug that you want to work on. 

If you happen to already have edit permissions in bugzilla, you can simply click on take bug.
Right there.


----

I'm going to switch to a tab that is logged in with a different user which doesn't have permissions though.  In that case it'll look like this.

What you'll want to do is post a comment in the bug asking if someone can make you the assignee.

If no one is assigned, there's no one working on the bug, so you can begin working on it even before you are marked as the asignee.

----

If you don't get a response within a day, or if you want to even sooner, please go on IRC in #developers or #introduction and simply say something like: "I'd like to be assigned to bug XYZ, my email account for bugzilla is blah@gmail.com.  could someone make me the asignee."

Someone will jump in and say sure, and do it.

----


To gain edit bugs permissions what you'll have to do is email:
bmo-perms@mozilla.org


Provide them with your bugzilla email.

And you want to either provide 2 links to bugs you provided patches on.
Or provide the link of 3 bugs where you wanted to make a change to a bug but couldn't.
