I just wnated to do a quick video on how to actually become a module peer.

First you should ask yourself why?
The answer should probably go something like: Your'e highly interested in this type of code, and you want to be more involved with it.

Your biggest responsiblity in becoming a peer on a module will be code reviews.

----

The first thing you want to do is to prove expertise in the area of the module.
To do that you need to basically create a lot of patches, and fix a lot of bugs in that module.
A good way to do this is to go in bugzilla under the component in question, and read through the bugs.
Then pick some and work on them.

> Show a bugzilla component

You also want show that you care about the component, that means help triage bugs and mentor bugs in that component. 

One way to keep up to date on a component is to watch the component in Bugzilla

> Show them the preference for component watching in Bugzilla


By doing a lot of bugs in the component, you'll quickly show expertise, or learn expertise.
You'll also learn about things to look out for in reviews naturally.

----

After a while, when you have a lot of patches in, and you feel comfortable, you can feel free to email a module owner or peer and asking them.
If you've been doing a lot of patches and showing a lot of promise, there should be no problem adding you as a reviewer.

In all honesty as you do a lot of patches, you'll probably naturally fall into the role of a module peer. 
The appointment as a peer will just be a formalization of a role you're already performing.
