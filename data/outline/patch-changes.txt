Assume we have this patch file, which fixes some whitespace:

Show diff of patch.

And suddenly we realize that we should have also fixed some more whitespace just below.

We could create a second patch file using qnew for the new change, but ideally we want the change in the same file.

To do this we simply modify the file as usual, with the new change.

Make a change to browser/base/content/browser.js

And then we type hg qref

And that's it! 

If you go look at the new patch file, you'll see that it now has that additional change in it.
